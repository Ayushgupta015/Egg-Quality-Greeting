Designed and implemented a machine learning model for grading egg quality using OpenCV for image processing. The project involved capturing images of eggs and analyzing features such as shape, size, and shell texture. Developed a classification algorithm using supervised learning techniques to categorize eggs into different quality grades. The model was trained on a dataset of labeled egg images and achieved high accuracy in grading based on industry standards. The model has a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 72.1%, precision of 60.4%, and recall of 72.9%.
